A responsive and animated browser game built using **React**, **Framer Motion**, **React Icons**, and **Bootstrap**. It’s simple in logic, smooth in performance, and made to run beautifully on any screen.

##  About the Project

This project is a personal experiment in building a game using **React Hooks** and modern libraries. I kept the logic clean and simple while adding motion and design polish to make it feel alive. It’s built with:
- **Functional components**
- **Reusable hooks**
- **Smooth animations**
- **Responsive Bootstrap layout**

Whether you’re on desktop or mobile, it just works.
